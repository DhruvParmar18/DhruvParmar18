##  Projects

* **Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Robotics with Cloud Deployment** (College project, Dec 2024)
    * Developed a TensorFlow/Keras LSTM autoencoder for real-time anomaly detection in robotic arm movements, processing data from a ROS simulator. 
    * Built a data pipeline to ingest and prepare time-series robotic arm data, incorporating MinMaxScaler for feature scaling. 
    * Evaluated model performance using reconstruction error and visualized results to identify abnormal movements. 
* **Risk Analysis Deep Learning Model** (Personal Project, Mar 2025)
    * Developed a time-series forecasting model using a TensorFlow LSTM network to predict financial asset returns; integrated features like rolling volatility, momentum, and macroeconomic indicators (CPI, GDP); achieved 70% accuracy improvement over ARIMA/Linear Regression baselines. 
    * Executed risk assessment by calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR); validated model accuracy using the Kupiec test. 
    * Designed and executed backtesting to evaluate model performance; visualized results and quantified accuracy with MAE, MSE, and R-squared. 

##  Experience

**Backend Developer - Python, Sciurus Analytics Ltd, London, UK (Feb 2022 - Present)** 

* Designed and implemented a scalable multi-tenant SaaS backend using Flask, REST APIs, and microservices.
* Debugged and maintained Python applications bug-free to ensure seamless delivery of APIs. 
* Designed, built, and optimized ETL pipelines using Python, Docker, AWS EventBridge, and S3 to process large actuarial datasets, resulting in a 40% improvement in data processing speed.
* Led DevOps initiatives by advising on and implementing CI/CD pipelines using CircleCI and AWS services, resulting in a 20% improvement in deployment frequency and a 90% reduction in deployment failures.
* Enforced infrastructure-as-code with Terraform for consistent environment provisioning; shortened onboarding and release cycles while improving environment parity. 
* Automated data quality checks and backup procedures with Boto3, improving the reliability of data used for analytics and freeing up team resources for more strategic initiatives. 
* Collaborated with stakeholders to plan, execute, and deliver key user-centric updates, liaised with clients through emails, Trello, and calls, and participated in daily agile stand-ups.
